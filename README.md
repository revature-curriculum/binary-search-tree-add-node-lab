# Instructions
In this lab you are given the `Node` class, a constructor of `Node(int x)`, and the method signature for your **insertion** method: `static Node insert(Node temp, int key)`.

Write your logic in place of the `TODO` line in the `insert()`'s body'. Do not forget to add a value to the givien variable `key` in the main method. Your method should return a Node value, and that said node value should have the appropriate relationship to a parent node.
> Nodes with a repeted value should traverse rightward, as if it were greater-than the parent node. 

# Test
You are free to test your code using as many `System.out.print()` statements to test your outputs. You can also run our pre-built test cases by going to the *Checkmark* tab on the left side, and hitting `run tests`.
> Test cases will check the placemnt of a new node, and the relationship of parent to child node.
